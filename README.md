# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This is a study guide for personal use during my bootcamp attendance as well as for other bootcamp attendees that may deem it useful. In building this web application, principles regarding HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript were learned and have laid the foundation for more in depth learning to come. This web application will continuously be updated during the next 6 months. 

## Installation

NA

## Usage

Notes can be reviewed that have been recorded here, the notes are specifically located in the HTML file. To help study any given topic, a function has been used within JavaScript to call out a random topic, while also listing the available topics to learn about and choose from. To access the randomly generated topic, the console window of the we application needs to be accessed. This can be accessed by pressing "F12" while on the web page, or by right clicking anywhere on the web page and selecting "inspect" (the very last option.)
